Create a React application that has a list of workers. A worker may be full time or part time, has a first and last name.

Let's create components to display full time workers or part time workers.
Each component will display its workers in a table.

When a worker's name is clicked on, their status changes from full time to part time or vice versa.

A new worker may be created by providing name and status (full time or part time - checkbox).

Use Redux to hold the state.
