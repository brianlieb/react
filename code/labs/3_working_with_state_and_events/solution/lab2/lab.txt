In this lab we will style the table of airport data so the heading line has a distinct color. Then, we will zebra code each line, even lines different from odd lines.

After that, when the user hovers the mouse over a line (not the heading line), change the airport name to all uppercase. When the user leaves that row, change the name back to mixed case.

Commands you need:
npm install
npm test

To view the coverage:
npm run coverage

To lint:
npm run eslint

After all tests pass:
npm run build
npm start
